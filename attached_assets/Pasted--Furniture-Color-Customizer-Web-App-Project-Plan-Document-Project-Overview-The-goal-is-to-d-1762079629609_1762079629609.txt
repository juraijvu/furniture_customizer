🪑 Furniture Color Customizer Web App — Project Plan Document
🧩 Project Overview
The goal is to develop a web-based furniture customization application where:
•	Users (clients/customers) can upload an image of a furniture item (sofa, chair, table, etc.).
•	They can select different areas of the furniture (e.g., seat, legs, edges).
•	They can change colors using the available company color palette.
•	The system will apply those color changes visually on the uploaded image.
•	Optionally: save, share, or submit the customized image for quotation or purchase.
________________________________________
🎯 Main Objectives
1.	Allow users to upload high-resolution furniture images.
2.	Provide an easy interface for selecting specific regions (using drawing tools or auto-detection).
3.	Apply new color tones realistically (maintain shadows, texture).
4.	Save or export the final preview for client use.
5.	(Optional) Admin dashboard for color scheme management and furniture model uploads.

🧠 Recommended Tech Stack
Layer	Technology	Reason
Frontend (Web UI)	React.js or Next.js	Interactive, responsive UI; supports real-time rendering.
Image Editing/Rendering	Fabric.js, Konva.js, or Three.js	Fabric.js for 2D color manipulation, Three.js for 3D furniture models.
Backend	Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (Express)	Handles uploads, API logic, image processing.
AI/Image Processing	OpenCV, TensorFlow.js, or Python Pillow (PIL)	Detect image regions, apply color filters, maintain texture.
Database	PostgreSQL or MongoDB	Store color palettes, furniture data, user preferences.
Cloud Storage	AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Cloudinary	Store uploaded and rendered images securely.
Deployment	AWS / Render / Vercel / DigitalOcean	Reliable hosting with scalability.

🧩 App Features Breakdown
🖼️ 1. Image Upload & Display
•	User uploads furniture photo (JPG/PNG).
•	App validates and previews it immediately.
•	File stored in temporary cloud storage.
🎨 2. Area Selection
Options:
•	Manual: User draws/marks areas using polygon or brush tool (via Fabric.js/Konva).
•	Auto: Use OpenCV to detect object boundaries (edges, seats, cushions).
🌈 3. Color Palette
•	Company provides pre-defined color palette (hex/RGB values).
•	User clicks to apply selected color to marked region.
💡 4. Realistic Rendering
•	Color overlay blended with furniture texture (via multiply/blend mode).
•	Maintain lighting/shadows for realism.
💾 5. Save/Download/Submit
•	Save configuration to user profile.
•	Download final preview image.
•	Send for quote or purchase.
🧑‍💼 6. Admin Dashboard (optional)
•	Upload new furniture templates.
•	Manage company color palettes.
•	View customer customization requests.

🧱 Prerequisites Before Starting Development
1.	Gather Requirements
o	List all furniture categories.
o	Define available color schemes.
o	Confirm if the app should support 2D photo or 3D model.
2.	Design UI Mockups
o	Use Figma or Adobe XD to design the user flow:
	Upload page
	Color selection panel
	Preview area
	Save/Download page
3.	Set Up Development Environment
o	Choose tech stack (React + Django recommended).
o	Set up GitHub repository and project folder structure.
o	Create database schema.
4.	Prepare Color Database
o	Add company colors (hex/RGB).
o	Store as records in DB.
5.	Prepare Initial Furniture Models
o	Upload sample furniture images.
o	(Optional) Predefine regions manually for accuracy.
6.	Set Up Backend APIs
o	/upload-image
o	/apply-color
o	/get-palettes
o	/save-customization
7.	Integrate Frontend + Backend
o	Connect via REST API or GraphQL.
o	Test real-time color preview.
8.	Testing & Optimization
o	Test various image sizes, lighting, and color accuracy.
o	Optimize image rendering speed.
9.	Deployment
o	Frontend → Vercel or Netlify.
o	Backend → AWS/Render.
o	Database → MongoDB Atlas or AWS RDS.
o	Storage → AWS S3.

⚙️ Possible Advanced Features (Future Scope)
•	3D furniture model rotation (Three.js + GLTF models).
•	Automatic object segmentation (using ML models).
•	AR preview (see furniture in real room via phone camera).
•	Customer login and order history.
•	Integration with eCommerce platform (Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.).

🧾 Example Color Change Workflow
1.	User uploads chair.jpg.
2.	App detects areas using OpenCV (seat, legs, arms).
3.	User picks “Dark Brown” for legs and “Beige” for seat.
4.	Backend overlays new colors using blending mode while preserving texture.
5.	Output preview is displayed and can be saved as custom_chair_1.png.
